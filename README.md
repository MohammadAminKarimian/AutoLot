# AutoLot Learning Project
This is a project I created to learn ASP.NET, RestApi and EF Core(ORM). It contains 2 web application (MVC, Razor) that allows users to create, read, update, and delete data from a database (CRUD) Using a service component. The application is built using the ASP.NET framework, EF Core and C#. Views are implemented by html, css, javascript but they are very basic and i'm working to improve that so that i can also boost my front skills.
Project is mainly based on a book project (Pro C# 10 with .NET 6 book Project by Andrew Troelsen and Phil Japikse)

## Components
The AutoLot data access layer consists of two projects, one to hold the EF Coreâ€“specific code (the derived
DbContext, context factory, repositories, migrations, etc.) and another one to hold the entities and view
models.
### AutoLot.Models
hold entities and viewModels which get used in dal or other components.

### AutoLot.Dal
hold all EF Core specific code (the derivedDbContext, context factory, repositories, migrations, dataInits etc.)
  #### Repositories
  provide encapsulated create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) access to the database.
  #### Data Initialization
  add data initialization code to provide sample data which is a common practice for testing data access layer.

### AutoLot.Services 
#### can work in 2 ways:
##### 1- Directly use DAL(Data access layer) component.
##### 2- Use api service as an Intermediary component between service and DAL component.

### AutoLot.Api
is a ASP.NET Web API which is designed to be a service-based framework for building
REpresentational State Transfer (RESTful) services. It is based on the MVC framework minus the V (view),
with optimizations for creating headless services. These services can be called by any technology, not just
those under the Microsoft umbrella. Calls to a Web API service are based on the core HTTP verbs (Get, Put,
Post, Delete) through a uniform resource identifier (URI)
#### this api receive data from, and send data back to, clients using JSON
### AutoLot Clients
#### AutoLot.Mvc (Model View Controller)
is an ASP.NET Core web application using the Model-View-Controller pattern 
#### AutoLot.Web (Razor pages)
is an ASP.NET Core web application using Razor pages
